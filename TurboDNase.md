#Turbo DNase treatment

Maxi TURBO prep for high levels of DNA. 
Kit will make 60 rxns.

1.	Prepare 90uL aliquots of RNA with up to  20 ug nucleic acid

2.	Add DNase
a.	Add 10 uL of 10x Turbo DNase buffer (0.1 volume).
b.	Add 1.0 uL TURBO DNase (2U).
c.	Mix gently with pipette.

3.	Incubate at 37°C for 30 mins

4.	Add another 1.0 ul of DNase and incubate for a further 30 mins.

5.	Add 100 ul of phenol-chloroform, mix by inverting or shaking until thoroughly mixed.

6.	Centrifuge at 14,000g for 10mins at 4°C.

7.	Transfer the upper phase (~100ul) to a fresh tube.

8.	Add 1 volume of cold isopropanol (~100ul) and 1/10 volume of 4M NaOAc, pH 5.2
a.	For higher yield and sRNA recovery incubate overnight @ -20°C
b.	Alternatively, incubate for 15 mins in -80°C freezer.

9.	Centrifuge samples for 20 mins, max g, at 4°C.  Remove supernatant with pipette.

10.	Rinse the pellet with 900uL of 70% ethanol, invert several times then centrifuge samples for 5 mins, 7,500 x g, at RT.  

11.	Remove EtOH with pipette. Pulse spin and remove remaining EtOH. Air dry 5 ins RT.

12.	Re-suspend in H<sub</sub>>2O or TRIS (eg 20uL).
