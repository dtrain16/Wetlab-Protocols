##Requirements for Precipitation

First, let’s review what we know about what is needed for precipitation of DNA or RNA with ethanol:

1. Salt to neutralize the charge on the nucleic acid backbone, causing the DNA to become less hydrophilic and fall out of solution.

2. Ice to chill the sample. Lower temperatures promote the flocculation of the nucleic acids so they form a larger complex that readily pellets under the centrifugal forces of a microcentrifuge.

3.  A nucleic acid concentration high enough to force the DNA out of solution (if the conc is not high enough, you can add a carrier nucleic acid or glycogen to enhance the recovery).

4. Centrifugation to pellet the sample

##Isopropanol Vs Ethanol: DNA Solubility

DNA is less soluble in isopropanol so it will fall out of solution faster and at a lower concentration, but the downside is that the salt will too. With ethanol, the DNA needs to be at a higher concentration to flocculate but the salt tends to stay soluble, even at cold temperatures.

DNA falls out of solution in 35% isopropanol and 0.5 M salt. Using ethanol, the final concentration needs to be around 75% with 0.5 M salt. So for the typical precipitation protocol, isopropanol is added from between 0.7–1 volumes of sample and ethanol is added at 2-2.5 volumes of sample.
Choosing the Right Solvent: Volume of Sample

If you are precipitating small volumes of DNA, and you can fit the required amount of solvent into the sample tube, then ice cold ethanol is the preferred choice. You can chill it (some people use liquid nitrogen or –80°C to accelerate the precipitation) and precipitate more DNA without the salt contamination that would occur from chilling isopropanol. Afterwards you need to wash the pellet with 70% ethanol to remove salt.

Isopropanol use useful for precipitations where you have a large sample volume  (e.g. the eluate you get after using a Qiagen plasmid Maxi Kit) because less solvent is needed, so you can fit the whole lot in the (15 ml) tube. But because salts are generally less soluble in isopropanol than in ethanol, they have more of a tendancy to co-precipitate with the DNA. So to lessen the chances of salt precipitation, isopropanol precipitations are carried our at room temperature with minimal incubation times.   Once the DNA or RNA pellet is recovered from the isopropanol, you’ll want to wash it with cold 70% ethanol to remove excess salt and to exchange the isopropanol with the more volatile ethanol. It is ok to chill the isopropanol precipitated sample, if you are sure that it is not excessively salty.

Because DNA is less soluble in isopropanol, isopropanol allows precipitation of larger species and lower concentrations of nucleic acids than ethanol, especially if you incubate it cold and long. If you do this, just remember to wash the pellet several times in 70% ethanol after pelleting, to reduce the amount of salt you carry over.
When to Use Ethanol or Isopropanol

###Use ethanol if:

  - You have room to fit two volumes of ethanol to sample in your tube.
  - The sample needs to be stored for a long period of time and will be chilled.
  - You need to precipitate very small pieces of DNA or you have a very low concentration of sample so you want to chill it longer and colder.

###Use isopropanol if:

  - You have limited in space in your tube and can fit only 1 volume of sample.
  - You need large molecular weight species because incubation at room temperature for short periods of time will not be conducive to precipitating small species of nucleic acid.
  - You are in a hurry and want to accelerate the precipitation of nucleic acids at room temperature

What do I prefer? I use ethanol over isopropanol for most cases, but will use isopropanol if I need to make everything fit in one tube. My preferred protocol is 2 volumes of ethanol and freeze at –20°C for at least an hour or overnight for best results. I centrifuge the sample at full speed for 20 minutes to make sure I get everything down. I always wash with 70% ethanol and then centrifuge for 10–15 minutes and keep my eye on the pellet when I decant everything. You need to note or mark the side of the tube where the pellet is expected to be and don’t let it out of your sight when decanting the ethanol!

If I use isopropanol, I avoid cold temperatures because of the excess salt that usually comes down with it. If I want to increase the yields precipitated, I prefer to leave it incubating at room temperature longer vs. chilling the sample. When the DNA is pelleted, the pellet is sometimes more difficult to see compared to the ethanol pellet. It can be clear and glassy. Make sure, again, to note the side of the tube where the pellet should be. Look for it before decanting the isopropanol and 70% ethanol wash. After washing with ethanol, the pellet becomes visible and white. I always make sure it doesn’t slip off the side of the tube wall before decanting the supernatant. Allow the tube to drain upside down for a few minutes and then air dry or speed vac dry (5 minutes is enough) and then resuspend in buffer.

Finally, for dry DNA pellets, heating the sample in buffer at 50–60°C will help the DNA dissolve faster and won’t damage the DNA. For RNA, heating can be used too (in water) at temps around 42°C. Overdried DNA and RNA will take longer to dissolve so make sure not to speed vac for too long.

So now you know the difference between ethanol and isopropanol and when to use which. If you have any questions, or anything to add, please drop a comment in below.

# Ethanol Precipitation of DNA and RNA: How it works

Also see [Ethanol Precipitation of DNA and RNA: How it works](http://bitesizebio.com/253/the-basics-how-ethanol-precipitation-of-dna-and-rna-works/) reproduced here:

Ethanol precipitation is a commonly used technique for concentrating and de-salting nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) preparations in aqueous solution.

The basic procedure is that salt and ethanol are added to the aqueous solution, which forces the precipitation of nucleic acid nucleic acids out of solution. After precipitation the nucleic acids can then be separated from the rest of the solution by centrifugation. The pellet is washed in cold 70% ethanol then after a further centrifugation step the ethanol is removed, and the nucleic acid pellet is allowed to dry before being resuspended in clean aqueous buffer. So how does this work?

## Ethanol precipitation of nucleic acids is all about solubility…

First we need to know why nucleic acids are soluble in water. Water is a polar molecule – it has a partial negative charge near the oxygen atom due the unshared pairs of electrons, and partial positive charges near the hydrogen atoms (see the diagram on the right).

Because of these charges, polar molecules, like DNA or RNA, can interact electrostatically with the water molecules, allowing them to easily dissolve in water. Polar molecules can therefore be described as hydrophilic and non-polar molecules, which can’t easily interact with water molecules, are hydrophobic. Nucleic acids are hydrophilic due to the negatively charged phosphate (PO3-) groups along the sugar phosphate backbone.

## The role of the salt in ethanol precipitation…

Ok, so back to the protocol. The role of the salt in the protocol is to neutralize the charges on the sugar phosphate backbone. A commonly used salt is sodium acetate. In solution, sodium acetate breaks up into Na+ and [CH3COO]-. The positively charged sodium ions neutralize the negative charge on the PO3- groups on the nucleic acids, making the molecule far less hydrophilic, and therefore much less soluble in water.

## The role of the ethanol…

The electrostatic attraction between the Na+ ions in solution and the PO3- ions are dictated by Coulomb’s Law, which is affected by the dielectric constant of the solution. Water has a high dielectric constant, which makes it fairly difficult for the Na+ and PO3- to come together. Ethanol on the other hand has a much lower dielectric constant, making it much easier for Na+ to interact with the PO3-, shield it’s charge and make the nucleic acid less hydrophilic, causing it to drop out of solution.

## The role of temperature in ethanol precipitation…

Incubation of the nucleic acid/salt/ethanol mixture at low temperatures (e.g. -20 or -80C) is commonly cited in protocols as necessary in protocols. However, according to Maniatis et al (Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual 2nd Edition… 2nd edition?? – I need to get a newer version!), this is not required, as nucleic acids at concentrations as low as 20ng/mL will precipitate at 0-4C so incubation for 15-30 minutes on ice is sufficient.

## The wash step with 70% ethanol…

This step is to wash any residual salt away from the pelleted DNA.

## A few tips on ethanol precipitation…

  1. Choice of salt
    - Use Sodium acetate (0.3M final conc, pH 5.2) for routine DNA precipitations
    - Use Sodium chloride (0,2M final conc) for DNA samples containing SDS since NaCl keeps SDS soluble in 70% ethanol so it won’t precipitate with the DNA.
    - Use Lithium Chloride (0.8M final conc) for RNA. This is because 2.5-3 volumes of ethanol should be used for RNA precipitation and LiCl is more soluble in ethanol than NaAc so will not precipitate, but beware – chloride ions will inhibit protein synthesis and DNA polymerase so LiCl is no good for RNA preps for in vitro translation or reverse transcription. In these cases, use NaAc.
    - Use Ammonium acetate (2M final conc) for the removal of dNTPs, but do not use for preparation of DNA for T4 polynucleotide kinase reactions as ammonium ions inhibit the enzyme.

  2. To increase the yield in precipitations of low concentration or small nucleic acid pieces (less than 100 nucleotides)
    - Add MgCl2 to a final concentration of 0.01M
    - Increase the time of incubation ice before centrifugation to 1 hour.
