# Pete's trizol RNA extraction: v1.1

Trizol extraction for Arabidopsis in 1.5 ml tubes, Based on the Millar lab Trizol protocol

## Reagents
  - Trizol <sup>**Caution nasty do not get on your skin</sup>
  - Chloroform
  - 1.5 ml RNase free tubes
  - 70% Ethanol
  - RNAse free water/TE for re-suspension

----
## Protocol
  1. Collect no more than 100 mg of tissue (a few leaves to one small rosette works well) and place in 1.5 ml tube, freeze on N<sub>2</sub> immediately
  2. Grind tubes for 1 min at freq 25, repeat if required
  3. Take an alliquot of trizol out of the stock bottle 1 ml x (number of sample + 1)
  3. Add 1 ml of trizol to each tube and mix by gently shaking (beware trizol can leak out so shake away from you)
  4. Incubate RT for 5 mins
  5. Add 200 ul of chloroform, shake vigorously and incubate at RT for 3 mins
  6. Centrifuge at 14,000 RCF for 10 mins at 4<sup>o</sup>C and transfer the upper aqueous phase to new tube (should recover 400-600 ul). *If DNA extraction is desired save the interphase and organic/phenol phase; this can be placed at 4<sup>o</sup>C overnight before proceeding with the DNA isolation procedure*.
  7. Repeat chloroform extraction once more (should recover >300 ul)
  8. Add an equal volume of 100% isopropanol (~400 ul) and mix by inverting the tubes
  9. Incubate in -20<sup>o</sup>C for at least 30 mins, over night if sRNA precipitation is desired
  10. Centirfuge at max RCF for 20 mins at 4<sup>o</sup>C
  11. Remove supernatant with pipette
  12. Add 1.0 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuge at RT for 3 mins at 7500 RCF
  13. Remove supernatant with pipette, pulse spin and remove remaining supernatant with fine tip
  14. Air dry at RT for 5 mins until pellets start to become translucent
  15. Add 50 ul RNAse free solvent (H<sub>2</sub>O or TE) and incubate at RT for 5 mins, mix with pipette and store at -80<sup>o</sup>C
  
For qPCR analysis proceed to DNase treatment.

Prepare a back extraction buffer: 4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 50 mM sodium citrate and 1 M Tris (free base).
  
|		Reagent		|Final			|1x (250 mL)		|1x (50 mL)	|
|:--------------|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
|Guanidine Thiocyanate 	(FW 118.2)	|		4 M	|	118.2 g		| 23.64 g			|
|Sodium Citrate NaCi (FW 294.1)			| 50 mM			| 3.68 g		|	0.736 g		|
|Tris (free base)Tris (FW 121.14)			|1M		|30.29 g			|		6.058 g	|
|DEPC H2O		|		| up to 250 mL			|		up to 50 mL	|

*Autoclaving is likely fine, but will probably use unautoclaved or filter sterilised.*

DNA extraction
 1. Remove any remaining aqueous phase overlying the interphase.
 2. Add back extraction buffer to the interphase-organic phase mixture. Use 500 μl of back extraction buffer per 1 ml of TRI Reagent used for the initial homogenization.
 3. Vigorously mix the sample by inversion for 15 sec and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.
 4. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4<sup>o</sup>C to separate the phases.
 5. Transfer the upper, aqueous phase containing DNA to a clean tube and save the interphase and organic phase at 4°C for subsequent protein isolation.
 6. *(Optional) If the expected DNA yield is less than 20 μg, add 2–8 μl of acrylamide carrier to the aqueous phase and mix.*
 7. Add an equal volue (~400-500 μl) of isopropanol to precipitate DNA from the aqueous phase. Mix the sample by inversion and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.
 8. Sediment the DNA by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 5 min at RT and remove the supernatant.
 9. Wash the DNA pellet with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, spin 12,000 g RT for 2 mins, aspirate ethanol. (Proceed with DNA Solubilization - *probably wont*)
 10. Dissolve DNA in water, 50-100 ul.

1. After removing the supernatant (containing the RNA), add a few volumes of ethanol to the rest, mix well and spin (5 min, 10,000 rpm, room temp). 
2. Dissolve pellet on ~100 ul of NTE+ 0.5% SDS at 80 <sup>o</sup>C. 
3. Extract with 1 vol of phenol:chloroform, spin at 10,000 rpm (room temperature) for 5 mins and collect the upper phase. 
4. Add 2 volumes of absolute EtOH, mix and spin the precipitate for 5 min at 10,000 rpm. 
5. Wash pellet with 75% EtOH, dissolve in 50 uL of TE at 65 <sup>o</sup>C. If the pellet is too big add more TE.
