Pete's trizol RNA extraction: v1.1
========
Based on the Millar lab Trizol protocol
----
1. Reagents
  - Trizol **Caution nasty do not get on your skin
  - Chloroform
  - 1.5 ml RNase free tubes
  - 70% Ethanol
  - RNAse free water/TE for re-suspension

----
2. Protocol
  1. Collect <10 mg of tissue -a few leaves to one small rosette works well - and place in 1.5 ml tube, freeze on N2 immediately
  2. Grind tubes for 1 min at freq 25, repeat if required
  3. Take an alliquot of trizol out of the stock bottle 0.75 ml x (number of sample + 1)
  3. Add 1 ml of trrzol to each tube and mix by gently shaking (beware trizol can leak out so shake away from you)
  4. Incubate RT for 5 mins
  5. Add 200 ul of chloroform, shake vigorously and incubate at RT for 3 mins
  6. Centrifuge at 14,000 RCF for 10 mins at 4oC and transfer the upper aqueous phase to new tube (should recover 400-600 ul)
  7. Repeat chloroform extraction once more (should recover >300 ul)
  8. Add an equal volume of 100% isopropanol (~400 ul) and mix by inverting the tubes
  9. Incubate in -20oC for at least 30 mins, over night if sRNA precipitation is desired
  10. Centirfuge at max RCF for 20 mins at 4oC
  11. Remove supernatant with pipette
  12. Add 1.0 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuge at RT for 3 mins at 7500 RCF
  13. Remove supernatant with pipette, pulse spin and remove remaining supernatant with fine tip
  14. Air dry at RT for 5 mins until pellets start to become translucent
  15. Add 50 ul RNAse free solvent (H2O or TE) and incubate at RT for 5 mins, mix with pipette and store at -20oC
  
3. For qPCR analysis proceed to DNase treatment.
