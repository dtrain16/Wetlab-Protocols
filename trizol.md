# Pete's trizol RNA extraction: v1.1

Trizol extraction for Arabidopsis in 1.5 ml tubes, Based on the Millar lab Trizol protocol

## Reagents
  - Trizol <sup>**Caution nasty do not get on your skin</sup>
  - Chloroform
  - 1.5 ml RNase free tubes
  - 70% Ethanol
  - RNAse free water/TE for re-suspension

----
## Protocol
  1. Collect no more than 100 mg of tissue (a few leaves to one small rosette works well) and place in 1.5 ml tube, freeze on N<sub>2</sub> immediately
  2. Grind tubes for 1 min at freq 25, repeat if required
  3. Take an alliquot of trizol out of the stock bottle 1 ml x (number of sample + 1)
  3. Add 1 ml of trizol to each tube and mix by gently shaking (beware trizol can leak out so shake away from you)
  4. Incubate RT for 5 mins
  5. Add 200 ul of chloroform, shake vigorously and incubate at RT for 3 mins
  6. Centrifuge at 14,000 RCF for 10 mins at 4<sup>o</sup>C and transfer the upper aqueous phase to new tube (should recover 400-600 ul). *If DNA extraction is desired save the interphase and organic/phenol phase; this can be placed at 4<sup>o</sup>C overnight before proceeding with the DNA isolation procedure*.
  7. Repeat chloroform extraction once more (should recover >300 ul)
  8. Add an equal volume of 100% isopropanol (~400 ul) and mix by inverting the tubes
  9. Incubate in -20<sup>o</sup>C for at least 30 mins, over night if sRNA precipitation is desired
  10. Centirfuge at max RCF for 20 mins at 4<sup>o</sup>C
  11. Remove supernatant with pipette
  12. Add 1.0 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuge at RT for 3 mins at 7500 RCF
  13. Remove supernatant with pipette, pulse spin and remove remaining supernatant with fine tip
  14. Air dry at RT for 5 mins until pellets start to become translucent
  15. Add 50 ul RNAse free solvent (H<sub>2</sub>O or TE) and incubate at RT for 5 mins, mix with pipette and store at -80<sup>o</sup>C
  
For qPCR analysis proceed to DNase treatment.

## Back extraction protocol for DNA
Source [ThermoFisher](https://www.thermofisher.com/au/en/home/references/protocols/nucleic-acid-purification-and-analysis/dna-extraction-protocols/tri-reagent-dna-protein-isolation-protocol.html)

Prepare a back extraction buffer: 4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 50 mM sodium citrate and 1 M Tris (free base).

Take 150 ml of millipore water and dissolve
  -	118.2 g of Guanidine Thiocyanate (FW 118.2)	= 4 M
  -	3.68 g of Sodium Citrate NaCi (FW 294.1) 	= 50 mM
  -	30.29 g of Tris (free base)Tris (FW 121.14) 	= 1M
  -	add additional millipore water until volume is 250 ml
  -	autoclave

DNA extraction
 1. Remove any remaining aqueous phase overlying the interphase.
 2. Add back extraction buffer to the interphase-organic phase mixture. Use 500 μl of back extraction buffer per 1 ml of TRI Reagent used for the initial homogenization.
 3. Vigorously mix the sample by inversion for 15 sec and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.
 4. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C to separate the phases.
 5. Transfer the upper, aqueous phase containing DNA to a clean tube and save the interphase and organic phase at 4°C for subsequent protein isolation.
 6. *(Optional) If the expected DNA yield is less than 20 μg, add 2–8 μl of acrylamide carrier to the aqueous phase and mix.*
 7. Add 400 μl of isopropanol per 1.0 ml of TRI Reagent used for the initial homogenization to precipitate DNA from the aqueous phase. Mix the sample by inversion and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.
 8. Sediment the DNA by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 5 min at 4–25°C and remove the supernatant.
 9. Wash the DNA pellet with 1 ml of 75% ethanol. (Proceed with DNA Solubilization - *probably wont*)
 10. Dissolve DNA in water, 50-100 ul.
