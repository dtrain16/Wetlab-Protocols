Pete's trizol RNA extraction: v1.1
========
Trizol extraction for Arabidopsis in 1.5 ml tubes, Based on the Millar lab Trizol protocol

----
1. Reagents
  - Trizol <sup>**Caution nasty do not get on your skin</sup>
  - Chloroform
  - 1.5 ml RNase free tubes
  - 70% Ethanol
  - RNAse free water/TE for re-suspension

----
2. Protocol
  1. Collect no more than 100 mg of tissue (a few leaves to one small rosette works well) and place in 1.5 ml tube, freeze on N<sub>2</sub> immediately
  2. Grind tubes for 1 min at freq 25, repeat if required
  3. Take an alliquot of trizol out of the stock bottle 1 ml x (number of sample + 1)
  3. Add 1 ml of trizol to each tube and mix by gently shaking (beware trizol can leak out so shake away from you)
  4. Incubate RT for 5 mins
  5. Add 200 ul of chloroform, shake vigorously and incubate at RT for 3 mins
  6. Centrifuge at 14,000 RCF for 10 mins at 4<sup>o</sup>C and transfer the upper aqueous phase to new tube (should recover 400-600 ul)
  7. Repeat chloroform extraction once more (should recover >300 ul)
  8. Add an equal volume of 100% isopropanol (~400 ul) and mix by inverting the tubes
  9. Incubate in -20<sup>o</sup>C for at least 30 mins, over night if sRNA precipitation is desired
  10. Centirfuge at max RCF for 20 mins at 4<sup>o</sup>C
  11. Remove supernatant with pipette
  12. Add 1.0 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuge at RT for 3 mins at 7500 RCF
  13. Remove supernatant with pipette, pulse spin and remove remaining supernatant with fine tip
  14. Air dry at RT for 5 mins until pellets start to become translucent
  15. Add 50 ul RNAse free solvent (H<sub>2</sub>O or TE) and incubate at RT for 5 mins, mix with pipette and store at -80<sup>o</sup>C
  
3. For qPCR analysis proceed to DNase treatment.
