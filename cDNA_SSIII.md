1. Prepare 1ug/10uL alliquots of total RNA
  * (it’s a good idea to prepare 50ul or more of each RNA sample @ 100ng/uL to use for cDNA, gels, etc)

2. Thaw oligoDTs, RT Buffer, dNTPs and H<sub>2</sub>O, spin briefly, then keep on ice

3. Prepare Primer master:  
  * (make sure dT(18VN) is 50uM or adjust volume accordingly - eg if 20uM add 2.5ul)


|Component	|__x Master Mix |	mass/Conc per rxn	|stock	| ul per rxn|
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|dT(18)VN	|	|2.5uM	|50pmol/uL	|1|
|dNTPs	|	|1mM	|10mM	|1|
|H2O	||			||2.5|
|total|[	4.5]|||4.5|

4. Add 4.5uL of oligoDT master to each reaction to make a total volume of 14.5uL

5. Denature RNA by heating at 65°C for 5 mins, meanwhile prepare RT Master Mix

6. Once denaturation has completed, immediately cool tubes on ice for at least 1 min

7. Prepare the Reverse transcription Master Mix

|Component	|__x Master Mix |	mass/Conc per rxn	|stock	| ul per rxn|
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Reaction Buffer	|	|1x	|5x	|4|
|DTT	|	|5mM	|0.1M	|1|
|SSIII	||			10U/ul|200U/ul|0.5|
|total|[	5.5]|||5.5|

*Optional: make some negative controls - see end for descriptions*

8. Add 5.5 ul of RT master mix to each reaction and mix by pipetting up and down gently

9. Spin briefly to collect contents to bottom of tube

10. Incubate at 50°C for 60 mins (increase temp to 55°C for gene specific primers or difficult templates)

11. Inactivate the RT by heating at 70°C for 15 mins, then stop the reaction by placing on ice

12. Store at -20°C

13. It is recommended that you dilute your cDNA to make it go further. 1ul = 1 qPCR reaction.
  * I prefer 1:4 dilution ie add 80ul of H2O to the 20 ul of cDNA; or 1:1.5 if target gene is low abundance eg APX2

##Negative control options
  * **No template control** – omits the DNA or RNA template from the PCR reaction. This reaction serves as a general control for unwanted nucleic acid contamination or primer dimmer formation that may make the results more difficult to interpret when using SYBR Green chemistry.		
  * **No reverse transcriptase control** – omits the reverse transcriptase in the reverse transcription step of a qRT-PCR reaction.  The purpose of this control is to assess the amount of DNA contamination present in an RNA preparation.
  * **No amplification control** - omits the DNA polymerase from the PCR reaction. This reaction serves as a control for background fluorescence of the PCR which may occur if the dual-labeled probe is degraded.
