Pete’s 96-well-trizol RNA extraction: v1.0
========
Based on the Millar lab Trizol protocol with inspriation from [Box et al*](http://www.plantmethods.com/content/7/1/7) 96-well RNA extraction protocol.

1 Reagents
- Trizol
- Chloroform
- Special plates
- 70% Ethanol
- RNAse free water/TE for re-suspension

2 Protocol
  1 Collect <50 mg of tissue – one small leaf works well – and place in 96-well tube-plate.
  2 Grind plate for 1 min at freq 25, repeat if required.
  3 Add 750 ul of trrzol to each tube and mix by gently shaking up-side down (beware trizol leaks – shake away from you)
  4 Incubate RT for 5 mins
  5 Add 150 ul of chloroform, shake vigorously and incubate at RT for 3 mins
  6 Centrifuge at 4500 RPM for 5 mins in plate spinner (increase spin time to 10 mins if we get a 4◦ plate centrifuge) and transfer the upper aqueous phase to new plate tube (should recover
  7 Repeat chloroform extraction once more (should recover 300 ul)
  8 Add an equal volume of 100% isopropanol ( 300 ul) and mix by inverting the tubes
  9 Incubate in -20◦ for at least 30 mins, over night if sRNA precipitation is desired 400 ul)
  10 Centirfuge at 4500 RPM for 20 mins in plate spinner (preferably at 4◦)
  11 Remove supernatant by inverting the plate
  12 Add 1.0 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuge at RT for 3 mins at 2500 RPM
  13 Invert plat to remove supernatant, pulse spin and remove remaining supernatant with double tips
  14 Air dry at RT for 5 mins until pellets start to become translucent
  15 Add 50 ul RNAse free solvent (H2O or TE)nd incubate at RT for 5 mins, mix with pipette and store at -20◦
