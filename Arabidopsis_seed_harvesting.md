# Arabidopsis seed harvesting

1. Harvest seed once siliques turn brown, if seed is left on dry/dead plants for an extended period it will start to deteriorate.
  2. Thrashing should occure when moisture content is aronud 10%.
2. Collect into brown paper envelopes and allow to dry at low humidity for 5-7 days.
  2. Seeds need to be dried to 5-6% moisture content, they will approximately equilibrate to match the realtive humidity of the room.
  3. Alternatively, dry in a dessicator
3. Trasnfer to cryovials at place in -80 for 2 days to kill thrips.
4. Place at 4 for storage; or leave at -80 for long term storage.
4. To use seed ensure tubes are fully warmed to room temp before opening to prevent moisture ruining seed.
