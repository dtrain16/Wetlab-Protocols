#MethylC-seq library preps for Illumina Sequencing v2.6

##Fragment gDNA

1. Start with 1-2 ug gDNA (use 1ug of fragmented DNA in library prep)
2. Prepare unmethylated phage DNA stock at 10 ng/ul and/or 2.5ng/ul, spike in 5ng (0.5% w/w).
  * eg stock at 491ng/ul: add 2.04ul to 97.96 ul EB to give 10ng/ul stock.
  * add 25ul of 10ng/ul stock to 75ul EB to make 2.5ng/ul stock
  * check stock dilutions on Qubit
3. Dilute 1000ng of gDNA sample in 128ul of EB and add 2.0ul of the 2.5ng/ul phage DNA (5ng; 0.5% w/w)
4. Sonicate 125ul on Convaris 200bp protocol, eg:
  * 1 x 60sec cycle of Duty 10%, intensity 5, cycles/burst 200
5. Run 10ul on a 1% gel (~120v x 30 mins) to check for smear from ~100-500bp
 
##Clean up fragmented gDNA
1. MinElute PCR clean as per manual
2. ELute twice with 17ul EB for a total 34 ul elution
