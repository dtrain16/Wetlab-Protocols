#MethylC-seq library preps for Illumina Sequencing v2.6

##Fragment gDNA

1. Start with 1-1 ug gDNA (use 1ug of fragmented DNA in library prep)
2. Prepare unmethylated phage DNA stock for 10 ng/ul, spike in 5ng (0.5% w/w).
  * eg stock at 491ng/ul: add 2.04ul to 97.96 ul EB to give 10ng/ul stock.
3. Dilute 1000ng gDNA in 128ul of EB and add 2.0ul
