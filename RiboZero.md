# RiboZero for Illumina RNAseq

*Half reactions protocol*

Adapted from Ribo-Zero Magnetic Kits Guide Rev A and TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Guide Rev E

## Prepare RNA
1. Prepare 1 ug (or up to 2.5 ug) of DNase treated RNA and confirm quality using GXII or other capilary gel electrophoresis (eg Bioanalyzer or RNA gel + Qubit).
  * *It is important to accuratly determine concentration for correct adjustment of rRNA removal solution ratio to sample*
 
## Prepare Beads
2. Equilibrate magnegtic beads to room temperature, vortex, take 112.5 ul aliquots and wash twice.
  1. Per reaction place 112.5 ul bead aliquit in RNase free tube/plate and place on magnet for 1 min or until solution clears
  2. Aspirate supertatant, remove from magnet and resuspend in 225 ul RNase free water.
  3. Repeat for a total of 2 washes
  4. Aspirate water and resuspend in 32.5 ul of Magnetic bead resuspension solution, vortex or pipette to homogonise.
    1. optional: add 0.5 ul of RiboGuard RNase Inhibitor
  5. Store at RT 

3. 

## Binding
1. In a 0.2 ml PCR tube combine:

   |Component | Volume|
   |:-:|:-:|
   |1 ug total RNA |  |
   |Ribo-Zero reaction buffer | 2 ul |
   |Ribo-Zero rRNA removal solution | 4 ul |
   |Water up to 20 ul |  |
   |total  | 20 ul |

2. Mix by pipetting 10-15 times
3. Incubate in thermocycler:

   |˚C | time|
   |:-:|:-:|
   |68˚C | 10 min|
   |4˚C | hold |

4. Spin to collect condensation and incubate at RT for 5 mins
5. Transfer the probe-hybridized RNA sample *to* the washed, room temperature Magnetic Beads (total volume 52.5 ul) and *immediatly* mix by pipetting (ie dont even change tips).
6. Mix all tubes by vortexing.

3. Incubate in thermocycler:

   |˚C | time|
   |:-:|:-:|
   |50˚C | 5 min|
   |4˚C | hold |

8. Immediately place tubes in magnetic rack for 1 min.
9. Remove 42.5 ul of supernatant and transfer to new tube.
