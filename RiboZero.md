# RiboZero for Illumina RNAseq

## Prepare RNA
1. Prepare 1-5 ug of DNAseq treated RNA and confirm quality using GXII or other capilary gel electrophoresis (eg Bioanalyzer or RNA gel + Qubit).
  * *It is important to accuratly determine concentration for correct adjust rRNA removal solution ratio to sample*
 
## Prepare Beads
2. Equilibrate magnegtic beads to room temperature, vortex, take 225 ul aliquots and wash twice.
  1. Per reaction place 225 ul bead aliquit in RNAseq free tube/plate and place on magnet for 1 min or until solution clears
  2. Aspirate supertatant, remove from magnet and resuspend in 225 ul RNase free water.
  3. Repeat for a total of 2 washes
  4. Aspirate water and resuspend in 65 ul of Magnetic bead resuspension solution, vortex.
    1. optional: add 1 ul of RiboGuard RNase Inhibitor
  5. Store at RT 

3.
