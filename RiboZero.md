# RiboZero for Illumina Truseq Stranded RNAseq Kit

*Half reactions protocol*
*Used when Ribo-Zero kit is purchased seperately, in combination with the Truseq mRNA kit (instead of the total RNA kit)*

Adapted from Ribo-Zero Magnetic Kits Guide Rev A and TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Guide Rev E

## Prepare RNA
1. Prepare 1 ug (or up to 2.5 ug) of DNase treated RNA and confirm quality using GXII or other capilary gel electrophoresis (eg Bioanalyzer or RNA gel + Qubit).
  * *It is important to accuratly determine concentration for correct adjustment of rRNA removal solution ratio to sample*
 
## Prepare Beads
1. Per reaction place 112.5 ul bead aliquit in RNase free tube/plate and place on magnet for 1 min or until solution clears
2. Aspirate supertatant, remove from magnet and resuspend in 225 ul RNase free water.
3. Repeat for a total of 2 washes
4. Aspirate water and resuspend in 32.5 ul of Magnetic bead resuspension solution, vortex or pipette to homogonise.
  1. optional: add 0.5 ul of RiboGuard RNase Inhibitor
5. Store at RT 

## Binding
1. In a 0.2 ml PCR tube combine:

   |Component | Volume|
   |:-:|:-:|
   |1 ug total RNA |  |
   |Ribo-Zero reaction buffer | 2 ul |
   |Ribo-Zero rRNA removal solution | 4 ul |
   |Water up to 20 ul |  |
   |total  | 20 ul |

2. Mix by pipetting 10-15 times
3. Incubate in thermocycler:

   |˚C | time|
   |:-:|:-:|
   |68˚C | 10 min|
   |4˚C | hold |

4. Spin to collect condensation and incubate at RT for 5 mins
5. Transfer the probe-hybridized RNA sample *to* the washed, room temperature Magnetic Beads (total volume 52.5 ul) and *immediatly* mix by pipetting (ie dont even change tips).
6. Mix all tubes by vortexing.

3. Incubate in thermocycler:

   |˚C | time|
   |:-:|:-:|
   |50˚C | 5 min|
   |4˚C | hold |

8. Immediately place tubes in magnetic rack for 1 min.
9. Remove 42.5 ul of supernatant and transfer to new tube.

## Purify RNA: AMPure RNA Clean XP beads

  ** 1.6x AMPure **
  
*Note: use 70% ethanol for RNA beads*

1. Add 68 μl of well-mixed RNA Clean XP beads and mix by pipetting up and down until beads are in a homogenous suspension.
34. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.
35. Place on magnetic rack for 5 min.
36. Remove and discard 109 μl of the supernatant.
37. Keep sample in magnetic rack and add 180 μl of 70% ethanol.
38. Incubate for 30 seconds.  Remove and discard all supernatant.
39. Repeat wash steps once more for a total of two washes, use a fine point tip to remove all ethanol after the second wash
40. Dry at 30˚C to 2-3 mins.
40. Add 6.7 μl Resuspension Buffer and pipette up and down until beads are in a homogenous suspension.
41. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.
42. Place in magnetic rack for 5 min.
23. Add 6.5 μl Elute, Prime, Fragment Mix and pipette up and down until beads are in a homogenous suspension.
24. Incubate in thermocycler (frag time can be between 1-8 mins, although median fragment size does not change significantly, only tail increases):

   |˚C | time|
   |:-:|:-:|
   |94˚C | 7 min|
   |4˚C | hold |

25. Immediately place sample in magnetic rack for 5 min.
26. Transfer 5.7 μl of the supernatant to a new 0.2 ml PCR tube.
