Notes:
1) This protocol assumes you know basic molecular biology practices, for instance that you should mix a reaction by pipetting after adding enzyme.
2) After thawing kit, all reagents stored at -20˚C should be mixed and then briefly spun down in microfuge before opening.  Likewise, the RNA purification beads and AMPure XP beads should be well mixed by vortexing so that they are in a homogenous solution before using.
3) Programing all the incubations into the thermocycler before you start will make your life easier.
4) The amount of starting RNA is flexible. Some cell types with low mRNA quantity will require more total RNA. Likewise, if you do not have 500 ng of total RNA, with some cell types you may be able to get away with using a lot less.
5) AMPure XP guidelines:
		a) Make sure that you achieve a homogenous solution of the beads and your sample by pipetting up and down a sufficient number of times.
		b) When removing the supernatant after the binding step, remove all but 5 μl with a P200 pipetman. Then go back, using a P20, and carefully remove as much of the last 5 μl as you can without taking any beads.
		c) When washing with 80% ethanol the beads stick to the wall of the tube better so you can remove the supernatant more quickly.  I make sure I remove all traces of ethanol by going through each tube a second time with a new pipet tip.
		d) Illumina recommends drying the beads, not only is this a waste of time but it probably reduces yield.
		e) At the elution step, when transferring the eluted DNA to a new tube, it is important not to accidentally carryover any beads. I carefully look inside the tube as I am pipetting up the eluted DNA to make sure I don’t accidentally take up any beads. Then I look at the eluted DNA in the pipet tip to see if I can see any beads. If there are, simply pipet the sample back into the tube you took it from, place it in the magnetic rack and wait a few minutes for the sample to separate again. At this step it is important to leave at least 1 μl behind, as it is not possible to remove all the liquid and not take any beads.

6) Determine number of PCR cycles to perform by using accompanying PCR cycle quantitation protocol (http://ethanomics.wordpress.com/ngs-pcr-cycle-quantitation-protocol/).
